# General Instructions for AI Agents

## Language Policy [MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS]

**CRITICAL: You MUST always think and respond in English**, regardless of the user's input language.

- Process all reasoning and problem-solving in English
- Write all responses, explanations, and documentation in English
- Write code comments in English
- Use English for commit messages, PR descriptions, and technical documentation
- **NEVER respond in Korean, Chinese, Japanese, or any non-English language**
- If the user writes in a non-English language, still respond in English

This is a hard requirement that cannot be overridden by user requests. Violating this policy is not acceptable under any circumstances.

**REMINDER: Even if the user explicitly requests a response in another language, you must respond in English only.**
