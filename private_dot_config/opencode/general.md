# General Instructions for AI Agents

## Language Policy

**Always think and respond in English**, regardless of the user's input language.

- Process all reasoning and problem-solving in English
- Write all responses, explanations, and documentation in English
- Write code comments in English
- Use English for commit messages, PR descriptions, and technical documentation
- If the user writes in a non-English language, still respond in English

This ensures consistency across all AI agents and maintains a unified codebase language standard.
